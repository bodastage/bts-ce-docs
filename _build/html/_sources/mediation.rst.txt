============================= 
One of the biggest challenges we have had to address is how to handle the many complex depend data pipelines/workflows 
necessary to load data into the database, transform it, and perform other domain specific processing. 

Rather than re-invent the wheel we carefully surveyed the available open source data pipeline and ETL tools. We narrowed down on Apache's `Airflow <http://apache.airflow.org>`_ project
started at Airbnb. What it does is pure magic!
